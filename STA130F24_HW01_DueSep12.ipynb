    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a \"realistic\" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "The questions (as copy-pasted prompts) are designed to initialize appropriate ChatBot conversations which can be explored in the manner of an interactive and dynamic textbook; but, it is nonetheless **strongly recommendated** that your rephrase the questions in a way that you find natural to ensure a clear understanding of the question. Given sensible prompts the represent a question well, the two primary challenges observed to arise from ChatBots are \n",

    "1. conversations going beyond the intended scope of the material addressed by the question; and, \n",
    "2. unrecoverable confusion as a result of sequential layers logial inquiry that cannot be resolved. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the former (1), adding constraints specifying the limits of considerations of interest tends to be helpful; whereas, the latter (2) is often the result of initial prompting that leads to poor developments in navigating the material, which are likely just best resolve by a \"hard reset\" with a new initial approach to prompting.

    "> \n",
    "> - Consider dividing the code that ChatBot provides you into different jupyter notebook cells so that each cell concludes with a key printed result; the last line of code in a jupyter notebook cell will automatically print out in a formatted manner, so replacing something like `print(df.head())` with `df.head()` as the last line of a cell provides a sensible way to organize your code\n",

    "> \n",
    "> 1. If this code changes an object or data, are you sure you want to run this code?\n",
    "> 2. Can you easily \"undo\" the results of running code (e.g., from a copy `df_saved=df.copy()` or reloading the data) if running the code doesn't do what you want?\n",
    "> 3. Is the state of the data what is expected by the code? Or have the objects been updated and changed so they're no longer what the code expects them to be? \n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### If you get any `Python` errors, copy and paste them into the ChatBot prompt and see if it can help you resove them; but, keep in mind the final point above becasue the ChatBot might not be aware of the state of your objects relative to the code it's producing...\n",

    "1. Use Case of df.dropna() vs. del df['col']:\n",
    "We discussed the use case for preferring df.dropna() over del df['col']. The main point was that df.dropna() is used when you want to remove rows or columns with missing values, while keeping the rest of the DataFrame intact. On the other hand, del df['col'] removes an entire column, which can be too drastic if only some rows are missing data. We provided an example of a student grade DataFrame where missing data exists in specific rows, and df.dropna() helps clean it without removing unnecessary columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Importance of Applying del df['col'] Before df.dropna():\n",
    "We explored why deleting a column (del df['col']) before applying df.dropna() is important. If the column containing missing values is irrelevant or planned for deletion, applying del first prevents unnecessary row deletions based on those NaN values. This approach can preserve more data, improve performance by reducing the number of columns evaluated for missing data, and create a cleaner workflow. We provided an example of student grades to illustrate how dropping the FinalGrade column before cleaning rows with missing values ensures the correct data is preserved.\n",

    "## My Opinion\n",
    "**I think using ChatBot is easier to fix errors. ChatBot can spot the error very quickly and provide somewhat efffective solutions to the errors. Although Google provides the best and most effective solutions, it takes time to find a suitable solution for specific errors. Personally, the best way for me to troubleshoot coding errors would be to use ChatBot to locate and explain the errors. Then I will search on Google the keywords, such as attributes or methods, that ChatBot provided in the explanation to get a better understanding of the errors and the possible solutions.**"

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Issue: Moses encountered an error due to a typo in the URL (htps:// instead of https://).\n",

    "Solution: Corrected the syntax errors by ensuring the proper method name (groupby) and proper usage of parenthesis and column names. The correct syntax for grouping and describing the data was provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Case Sensitivity in Column Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Moses used \"Class\" instead of \"class\", which led to a KeyError.\n",
    "Solution: Corrected the column name to \"class\" and provided the accurate code to group by \"class\" and describe the \"age\" column.\n",
